# TestCode
A few things you should know:
  1. No Library used(It was the rule when I first received the test). Only native swift xcode tools and items are used
  2. Because I could not find any api for search (which is the correct way to search), I have implemented search and sort basd on available data in local storage.
  3. Multiple improvement and more test coverage could be applied but with the limited time I had, I think this shows my work
